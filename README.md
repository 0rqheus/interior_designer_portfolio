# Interior designer portfolio

In this project you can see information about the designer, his works and order them. Also you can make an appointment using calendar. 

Firebase is used to authorize and store orders and appointments in firestore database. Works are storing in algolia because firestore doesn't provide full-text search. As a multimedia storage, cloudinary is using.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
